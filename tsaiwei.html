    <h1>This is Tsai Wei.</h1>
    <p>Tsai Wei is a Year 2 undergraduate student at the National University of Singapore, working towards an Industrial Design (Hons) degree. She is inclined towards the Service Design and Computational Design sectors. Sociology and the psychology of human behaviours fascinate her and play a big role in her approach towards design. She believes that design should be used to solve problems and help people and hopes to be able to put her skills to use for these purposes in the near future.
    <br> <br> In her free time, Tsai Wei works on developing her hands-on skills as a designer through hobbies such as crocheting, sewing and various Do-It-Yourself (DIY) projects to add to the décor of her surroundings. She also enjoys picking up new languages, having a certification from a Level One Singapore Sign Language class and is now learning German. She hopes to be able to pick up Spanish someday as well. Perhaps she should have been a language major.

   <h2>As a budding designer...</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tsai Wei enjoys analyzing real world problems and coming up with solutions using different design approaches. Looking at the issue from different stakeholders’ perspectives provides a more in depth understanding of the problem. Repeated user tests and refinements then allow her to devise an appropriate solution. This is a process that brings her a sense of achievement, knowing her efforts made the world better.</li>
      <li>Although she enjoys the freedom of working individually, Tsai Wei also a good team player. She brings to the table new ideas and insights to support the team in their work. Her easy-going  personality makes her a delight to work with while her innate cynicism provides critical feedback for improvement. Her astute observations about people’s behaviours often aid the team in devising appropriate design solutions.</li>
      <li>Despite not possessing any coding experience, Tsai Wei appears to have a propensity for programming. During a previous project requiring the use of Arduino, she was able to pick up the programming language quickly with minimal guidance. She looked forward to every new problem and faced them head on tirelessly. It was an exciting challenge to her and brought about the satisfaction of solving a difficult math problem.</li>
      <li>Tsai Wei is very meticulous in her work, especially with regard to hands-on modelling. She prioritizes accurate measurements and takes careful steps in the construction process. This often yields finely-crafted objects and prototypes when time allows.</li>
