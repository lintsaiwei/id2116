    <h1>This is Tsai Wei</h1>
    <p>Tsai Wei is a Year 2 undergraduate student at the National University of Singapore, working towards an Industrial Design (Hons) degree. She is inclined towards the Service Design and Computational Design sectors. Sociology and the psychology of human behaviours fascinate her and play a big role in her approach towards design. She believes that design should be used to solve problems and help people and hopes to be able to put her skills to use for these purposes in the near future.
    <br> In her free time, Tsai Wei works on developing her hands-on skills as a designer through hobbies such as crocheting, sewing and various Do-It-Yourself (DIY) projects to add to the d√©cor of her surroundings. She also enjoys picking up new languages, having a certification from a Level One Singapore Sign Language class and is now learning German. She hopes to be able to pick up Spanish someday as well. Perhaps she should have been a language major.
