    <p>I'm Tsai Wei, a Year 2 undergraduate student at NUS, working towards an Industrial Design degree. 
    <br>In my free time, she also enjoys picking up new languages, having a certification from a Level One Singapore Sign Language class and is now learning German. She hopes to be able to pick up Spanish someday as well. 
    <br>Perhaps she should have been a language major.
