  <h1>Week 5 - Continuation of html and p5.js Video Player</h1>
  <br>

   <h2>html</h2>
   <p>We have finally figured out how to centralize our images and texts! Our avatars can even change when you hover over it woohoo!!!</p>

   <h2>p5.js</h2>
    <p> We also resolved our randomized video player problem :)
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/lintsaiwei/sketches/Y6G36ubi"> Check it out here hehe</a>
</p>
  
  <h2>Observations and Obstacles</h2>
   <li>We always forget to check the name of the video leading to errors...</li>
   <li>Images on webpages disappeared again...we edited the location path but...why (we probably moved the files by accident)</li>
   <li>and the links back to the homepage are not working, even though it did last  week. And then we added ..// and they work again.</li>
   <li>Also notice that the weekly webpages are colour-coded ;)</li>

   <h4>back to <a href="..//index.html">homepage</a> </h4>
