  <h1>Week 5 - Continuation of html and p5.js Video Player</h1>
  <br>

   <h2>html</h2>
   <p>We have finally figured out how to centralize our images and texts! Our avatars can even change when you hover over it woohoo!!!</p>

   <h2>p5.js</h2>
    <p> We also resolved our randomized video player problem :)

  <h2>Observations and Obstacles</h2>
   <li>"is Shake gesture" did not react and we had to create a separate chain using "on Shake". We suspect the microbit might be a little insensitive.</li>
   <li>We have an idea of have the mirror cheer or "boo" when someone is in front of it but that will require a speaker and attachment of sound bites.</li>
