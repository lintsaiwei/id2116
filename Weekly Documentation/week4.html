   <h1>Week 4 - Creating Interaction and Output</h1>
   <h2>also some (a lot of) struggles with html</h2>

   <h1>Last Week's p5.js struggles...</h1>

   <li>We used 3 different coloured lights with 3 LEDs each to represent the blinking pattern in each of the 3 scenarios</li>
   <li>However, many of the pins had some problems that caused the LEDs to light up when they are not supposed to</li>
   <li>Coding each LED separately also meant many tangled wires and a very lengthy code</li>
   <br>

   <h1>html</h1>
   <li>Code for flashing LEDs/LED strip at various different speeds and colours</li>
   <li>Servo motor's randomized movement that matches with the lights and sounds</li>
   <li>Use a speaker for sound or connect to com4puter</li>
